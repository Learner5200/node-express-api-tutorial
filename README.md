* A RESTful API build using Node, Express and Mongo, based on [this tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ka5fYysBM), intended to help me learn these technologies.

## Features

* Endpoints:
  - `/products`: GET, POST
  - `/products/{id}` - GET, PATCH, DELETE
  - `/orders` - GET, POST
  - `/orders/{id}` - GET, DELETE
* Authentication: certain routes are protected.
